Logo Concept

Core idea:
A minimal sigil-style logo that represents memory, connection, and cognitive clarity.
It should feel calm yet intelligent — fitting both AI memory and knowledge graph aesthetics.

Concept Directions:

Memory Node Network: interconnected circular nodes forming an "R" or brain-like pattern. Symbolizes the memory graph and neural connections.

Cognitive Orb: geometric orb with subtle glow and internal connection lines — represents a memory being captured and stored.

Voice Wave + Brain: subtle sound wave that morphs into neural pathways or brain silhouette, emphasizing voice-first memory capture.

Minimal Glyph: thin sans-serif "relevel" wordmark with a subtle orb or node icon above the 'r' (like a thought being captured).

Color Palette:

Lavender / Indigo gradient: #8F7BFF → #C6B5FF

Deep midnight accent: #0E0A1E

Soft silver: #EDEDF8

Cyan accent (for memory nodes): #00D4FF

Prompt for Generation (if you want me to generate it):

"Minimal logo for relevel.me — a voice-first second brain platform where thoughts become connected memories. The logo should depict memory nodes or neural connections forming an 'R', representing a personal knowledge graph. Lavender-indigo palette, clean lines, glowing memory orbs, dark background with mystical clarity aesthetic."
