# relevel.me - A second brain you can call

## Core Concept

Think aloud. Remember everything. Relevel.me transforms your voice into structured memory — capturing ideas, reflections, and insights in real time through natural conversation.

## The Memory Companion

Your AI companion listens like a friend, remembers everything you share, and helps you think with clarity. Call anytime to speak your thoughts freely — no typing, no friction, just conversation.

## How It Works

- **Voice-First Capture**: Call and speak your thoughts naturally
- **Memory Graph**: Each idea becomes a node, connected by meaning
- **Reflective Intelligence**: Your AI companion surfaces forgotten goals and patterns
- **Zero Friction**: Instant capture, effortless recall

## Optional Visualization

Your evolving memory can be visualized as:
- **Memory Orbs**: Connected nodes representing your knowledge
- **Skill Trees**: Optional gamification showing cognitive growth
- **Knowledge Networks**: Visual representation of how your thoughts connect

## The Avatar

The 3D avatar represents your virtual self — your cognitive mirror in the digital space. You can customize and name it to reflect your identity.
